                <h1> <strong>Music</strong></h1>
                <p> Electronic music was a major aspect in the development of music as a whole throughout the 20th Century. The development of electronic musical instruments was as a result of the various experiments by the music producers and composers using the emerging electronics. The electronic musical instruments were used to reproduce existing music and for public performance instead of producing a new song. Some of the instruments, such as the Telharmonium, were able to synthesize sounds of orchestral instruments. Ferruccio Busoni encouraged the use of electronic instruments in the composition of microtonal music. He was instrumental in the promotion of electronic music predicting the use of a machine in future music production, a prediction which came true almost immediately.</p>
